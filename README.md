# Open re-implementation of the Quansheng UV-K5/K6/5R v2.1.27 firmware

This repository is a fork of [Armel's F4HWN firmware v2.8.1](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom) which was based on [Egzumer custom firmware](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom) which was a merge of [OneOfEleven custom firmware](https://github.com/OneOfEleven/uv-k5-firmware-custom) and [fagci spectrum analizer](https://github.com/fagci/uv-k5-firmware-fagci-mod/tree/refactor).

Notable features:
* FM Broadcast reception and Spectrum Analyzer always available--Forever!
* Menu reorganized slightly to group channel settings together and move more frequently used options near default position. Still in progress--suggestions welcome!
* Vox disabled. No more accidentally toggling it on.
* Direct scanlist selection for channels (`F` + `1-3` in main screen)
* Direct scanlist selection while scanning (`0` for No Lists, `1-3` to select a list, `*` to toggle between All Lists and Everything)
* Spectrum analyzer squelch MUCH faster in spectrum mode (need testers to see what I might have broken though!)
* Press Menu on partial channel input to jump to channel, for those cases when you forget to start the input with `0`.
* Smoother battery % changes, no skipped steps.
* FM 0.2MHz steps (scanning is twice as fast). Make sure to switch to 87.5-108M if you're in the USA!
* Global scan skip. When in channel scan mode, long-press Menu to skip channel. When not scanning, long-press Exit to unskip.
* Monitor mode while in scan mode, just like Yaesu!
* Dual watch while scanning. Scans the other VFO's channel 20% of the time. If other VFO gets in the way with unwanted transmissions, skip it by long-pressing Menu.

All is a cloned and customized version of DualTachyon's open firmware found [here](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) ... a cool achievement !

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception anything but
easy (AM mode will suffer far more than FM ever will), the receiver simply doesn't have a
great dynamic range, which results in distorted AM audio with stronger RX'ed signals.
There is nothing more anyone can do in firmware/software to improve that, once the RX gain
adjustment I do (AM fix) reaches the hardwares limit, your AM RX audio will be all but
non-existent (just like Quansheng's firmware).
On the other hand, FM RX audio will/should be fine.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## Compiler

arm-none-eabi GCC version 10.3.1 is recommended, which is the current version on Ubuntu 22.04.03 LTS.
Other versions may generate a flash file that is too big.
You can get an appropriate version from: https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm

clang may be used but isn't fully supported. Resulting binaries may also be bigger.
You can get it from: https://releases.llvm.org/download.html

## Building

### Github Codespace build method

This is the least demanding option as you don't have to install enything on your computer. All you need is Github account.

1. Go to https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom
1. Click green `Code` button
1. Change tab from `Local` to `Codespace`
1. Click green `Create codespace on main` button

<img src="images/Code_Space_1.png" width=700 />

5. Open `Makefile`
1. Edit build options, save `Makefile` changes
1. Run `./compile-with-docker.sh` in terminal window
1. Open folder `compiled-firmware`
1. Right click `firmware.packed.bin`
1. Click `Download`, now you should have a firmware on your computer that you can proceed to flash on your radio. You can use [online flasher](https://egzumer.github.io/uvtools)

<img src="images/Code_Space_2.png" width=700 />

### Docker build method

If you have docker installed you can use [compile-with-docker.bat](./compile-with-docker.bat) (Windows) or [compile-with-docker.sh](./compile-with-docker.sh) (Linux/Mac), the output files are created in `compiled-firmware` folder. This method gives significantly smaller binaries, I've seen differences up to 1kb, so it can fit more functionalities this way. The challenge can be (or not) installing docker itself.

### Windows environment build method

1. Open windows command line and run:
    ```
    winget install -e -h git.git Python.Python.3.8 GnuWin32.Make
    winget install -e -h Arm.GnuArmEmbeddedToolchain -v "10 2021.10"
    ```
2. Close command line, open a new one and run:
    ```
    pip install --user --upgrade pip
    pip install crcmod
    mkdir c:\projects & cd /D c:/projects
    git clone https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom.git
    ```
3. From now on you can build the firmware by going to `c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom` and running `win_make.bat` or by running a command line:
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    win_make.bat
    ```
4. To reset the repository and pull new changes run (!!! it will delete all your changes !!!):
    ```
    cd /D c:\projects\uv-k5-firmware-custom
    git reset --hard & git clean -fd & git pull
    ```

I've left some notes in the win_make.bat file to maybe help with stuff.
